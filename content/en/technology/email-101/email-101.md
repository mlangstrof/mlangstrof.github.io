For better or worse, if you work any kind of corporate or office job, emails will take a prominent spot in your daily work schedule. They are arguably still the most important means of communicating, since they are both (nearly) instantaneous but also asynchronous and allow the transfer of structured information.

However, they are also one of the technologies that are rarely trained, since most people assume that writing a mail, be it digital or analog, is obvious. While that may be true in general, there is a significant gap between a well-crafted email and a poorly written barely understandable one. This post aims to give a sort of crash course based on personal experiences and opinions in how to write effective messages.

# Do 

- **use brackets with qualifiers** in subject line like \[Urgent\], \[Info\], \[Action Required\], \[Signature required\], \[Decision required\] or \[Request for Information\]. This makes it easier for the receiver to categorize your mail when skimming the subject
- Use the **"Bottom Line Up Front"** (BLUF) approach:
  - *Subject Line:* Clearly indicate the purpose of the email, such as "Action Required: Approve Project Proposal by Nov 20."
  - *Opening Sentence:* Begin with the main point or required action. For example, "Please review and approve the attached project proposal by November 20."
  - *Supporting Details:* Follow with necessary context or background information to support the main point.
  - Make sure to answer the *five Wâ€™s:* who, what, where, when, and why
- use **importance** tag: Most email client support sending an email with "high importance", which makes the message pop out and can be used when creating rules in the email client.
- use **sensitivity** labels: If your organization has introduced sensitivity labels, always make use of them to ensure data is classified and protected accordingly
- use the **receiver, copy and blind copy** fields correctly:
  - if information in the email is directly relevant to the receiver or you expect a response, put his email address in the "receiver" field
  - if the information in the email is indirectly relevant ("for your information") and the receiver does not need to respond, put his address in the "CC" field
  - if you are sending an email to people who do not have each others contact information and this information should not be shared, put their addresses into the "BCC" field.
- Ensure that when sending links the receiver can open them (do not send links to the intranet if the receiver is not part of the company, if you share files from SharePoint, OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Cloud etc. make sure the receiver has adequate rights or can request these rights easily)
- **reply to conversation**: always reply to a mail when discussing an ongoing topic, do not write a new email as this way the context is lost. Do not remove the history of the past emails when replying, unless it is no longer pertinent to the issue discussed!
- **make consistent use of highlighting** according to the desired level of emphasis: italics < underlined < bold < font color < spaced < highlighted
- **quoting**: when quoting a previous email, either: 
  - note that you are answering in line below, then in a different font color underneath the previus content using your initials first, put your answer 
  - copy the whole paragraph, put a > in front and give it a slight indentation (one tab), then underneath put your answer

# Consider also

- using a **signature** for outside communication containing your contact details, normal work hours and if applicable advanced warning of time off
- using **markdown structure**: since markdown structure has a high legibility even unparsed, it can be well used to quickly write mails no matter what client you are using

# Do Not

- Use **smaller font size than 10 pt**: if the font is too small, it is hard to read, especially on mobile devices
- Use **anything but a standard sans-serif font** (and doubly so, do not use comic sans): emails are meant to convey information, not be art pieces. Don't be fancy, be legible
- use **too many different colors, colors that are too light or not accessible**: Too many colors cause confusion and colors that are too light or which are impacted by common disabilities (like red green blindness) can make them hard to read for the receiver.
- directly **send large files**: Large files can cause failures in delivery and extend the duration of sending and receiving, use links to the files (e.g. OneDrive or Dropbox) instead wherever possible
- include a lot of and/or **very large pictures** in the body of the email
