Welcome to my corner of the web! My name is Max Langstrof —a seasoned solution architect and DevSecOps engineer with a passion for cracking the code on complex cloud-based workloads. Whether I’m designing secure, automated Azure solutions or digging into the nitty-gritty of how Azure services tick under the hood, I thrive on solving puzzles and turning chaos into clarity.

But there’s more to me than tech! When I’m not wrangling cloud services, you’ll find me swirling wine glasses and training my taste buds. With certifications like WSET Level 3 and the Italian Wine Scholar already under my belt—and more to come—I’m on a lifelong mission to sip, savor, and share the magic of wine with anyone willing to listen.

This blog is where my worlds collide—a space for musings, observations, and a splash of humor on all things IT and wine. So pour yourself a glass (or brew some coffee), and let’s dive in!
