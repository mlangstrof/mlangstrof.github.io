In my [previous post](https://mlangstrof.github.io/en/wine/a-wee-whisky-journey-1/), I set the stage for a deeper dive into Islay whisky by walking you through its production – highlighting the unique conditions, machinery, and techniques that give rise to this sublime spirit. Now that we've covered the *how*, I’d love to take you on a short journey through Islay’s iconic distilleries while sharing personal impressions, curious facts, and perhaps helping you discover which "house of spirits" might best suit your palate.

# Islay and its whisky

![islay distilleries](images/islay_distilleries.webp "500px")

Chances are, the first thing to greet you on Islay – whether you arrive by sea or sky – will be brisk winds and perhaps (if you are unlucky) a brief, involuntary shower. Set adrift from the Scottish mainland, the island is sculpted by unrelenting maritime gusts with little in the way of natural protection. While the inland features gentle hills and modest peaks, the coastal areas remain open, flat and exposed. When drawing your first breath, you are greeted by the salty ocean air which conveys a bracing freshness that is among the defining influences shaping the character of Islay’s whiskies.

As you head inland, a landscape of luscious green fields unfolds, that reminded me instantly of the *Emerald Isle*. Our cab driver pointed out that Ireland is not only close by, but that on a clear day, you can even glimpse its coastline with the naked eye. In fact Islay is almost equidistant from Scotland and Ireland and its vegetation certainly reflects that. The vivid green is interspersed with brown spots, which are indicative of the peat that the island is known for – and another crucial aspect that shapes the character of the local whisky. Peat is a unique type of soil formed from partially decomposed plant matter, layered over time into dense, dark slabs that resemble dried earth. Due to the compression that happens over time while layer upon layer gets added to the top, it is quite energy dense and as fuel somewhere between wood and coal. Curiously, peat has little to no aroma on its own – its famously smoky character only emerges when it’s set alight. 

Of course the rugged, rural landscape wouldn't be complete without some livestock and you'll often see sheep and cows grazing on the meadows. Rumor has it, even the island’s livestock are whisky enthusiasts. They’re especially fond of *draff*, the protein- and fiber-rich barley residue left behind in the mash tun after mashing. While most sugars have been extracted during the fermentation, it still retains a slightly sweetish taste that the animals rather enjoy. The island is also home to farms that grow hay, silage and barley, the latter being used primarily in the local whisky production. If you move your gaze towards the open waters, you might see some fishing boats, catching crabs, lobsters, scallops, oysters or fish from the island's coast, delicacies which you are sure to find on the menu of the restaurants in Port Ellen, Bowmore or Port Charlotte. 

Islay may not be big, but (partly) due to the whisky tourism still offers a sizeable number of restaurants with excellent food – I can vouch for the seafood, particularly the astoundingly big oysters. Lovers of particularly peaty whisky might also be enticed by the prospect of eating beef that grazed on the famous Octomore fields. Naturally there are also vegetarian options, though ordering a traditional Scottish breakfast is disadvised in that case, as most of the plate will consist of animal products. In terms of quality, I would particularly recommend the Port Charlette Hotel, the food was fresh and cooked to perfection and the staff knowledgeable and friendly. Another plus: It has a decent selection of wine and a great selection of whisky, as well as a bar on the opposite side of the building, so you can easily catch a nightcap after your meal.

Only around 3,000 people call Islay home year-round, scattered among its villages, farms, and cottages – even fewer are actually born there and are thus allowed to call themselves Ìleach (pronounced *ilach*). The natives are very welcoming, friendly and humble, and even though their whisky has found worldwide acclaim, they still seem very much down to earth. I was pleasantly surprised that even though especially the bigger distilleries have their fixed catalog of whiskies, tours and tasting experiences, not everything is about money and you will often get more than you paid for. If you visit high-profile wineries, it can sometimes feel like an expensive, rushed and highly choreographed experience, far removed from any joy about the actual product. Islay felt more authentic and the inhabitants genuinely proud and excited about their island and their spirits and eager to share their enthusiasm.

# The Fèis Ìle festival

[Fèis Ìle](https://feisile.co.uk/) (pronounced roughly  *fesh eel-uh*) is an annual celebration of Islay and its renowned distilleries, taking place during the last week of May. The origins of the festival date back to 1986, making next year (2026) its 40th anniversary. Over the festival’s ten-day run, each day spotlights a different distillery. Expect bustling courtyards brimming with food and drink stalls, live music on central stages, and exclusive behind-the-scenes tours. Many distilleries also offer immersive tasting experiences: From curated flights of rare casks to access to normally off-limits areas, cocktail workshops, blend-your-own classes, or informal meet-and-greets with the head distiller or distillery manager. 

Each distillery brings its own flair to the occasion – some, like **Bruichladdich**, host raucous, high-energy parties, while others, such as **Laphroaig**, favor a more laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere, complete with historic charm and even activities like archery. Beyond the distilleries, the festival committee organizes a wide range of events, such as whisky tasting contests, music-and-dance performances or showcases by independent bottlers. There’s even room for non-whisky related fun, like fishing competitions or community bowling nights.

Most distillery days are open to all, often with no ticket required. However, special tastings and committee-run events do book out fast,  so be sure to reserve your spot well in advance. Another topic is transportation: It goes without saying that you **should not drink and drive**, but public transportation on the island is irregular and at least in 2025 there were no designated shuttles to most destillery days. Therefore I'd recommend arranging for transport beforehand or expect some waiting time, as cabs will be busy and may take a while to pick you up if you call without prior reservation.

# The distilleries of Islay

Islay is currently home to ten active distilleries, scattered across its wild and windswept terrain. On the southern coast lie **Ardbeg**, **Lagavulin**, **Laphroaig**, and the recently reopened **Port Ellen** destillery; **Bowmore**, **Bruichladdich**, and **Kilchoman** anchor the island’s west, while **Caol Ila**, **Ardnahoe**, and **Bunnahabhain** are tucked along the northwestern shore. Two new sites – **Portintruan** near Port Ellen and **Laggan Bay** near the airport – are already under construction and slated to open soon. The island’s oldest distillery is Bowmore, named after Islay’s capital city, where it was founded shortly after the town itself in 1779. 

Intriguingly, many distilleries predate their official founding dates, having operated as illicit stills during the days when whisky production was outlawed. That’s why some sites feature hidden rock caverns, that were used to stash barrels of moonshine  during the prohibition era. According to local lore, some resourceful maltmen even diverted smoke from the kilns and stillhouses into the chimneys of nearby cottages, thus cleverly concealing the telltale signs of their forbidden craft.

## Laphroaig

![islay distilleries](images/laphroaig_destillery.png "500px")
Laphroaig is the first stop on the aptly named *Three Distillery Walk*, which begins just east of Port Ellen. If you arrive by plane, as I did, and are lucky enough to snag a window seat, you may spot the bold black letters spelling *LAPHROAIG* on a pristine white warehouse along Islay’s southern shore. You might even catch sight of what could be the distillery’s most devoted fan – a dog belonging to one of the local families, that is often found strolling leisurely around the nearby beach, always on the lookout for someone willing to throw his stick.

The producers location is certainly one of the most impressive in Islay with a large central yard flanked by gleaming white buildings and a clear view of the Atlantic just beyond. Inside the visitor centre, past the gift shop, you'll find a small museum chronicling the distillery’s long and eventful history. Founded in 1815 by Donald and Alexander Johnston, Laphroaig remained a family-run operation until it eventually passed to Ian Hunter, the visionary nephew of Sandy Johnston. It was Hunter who purchased the land beneath the distillery and its adjoining farm and shifted focus to building Laphroaig’s international reputation and increasing exports. In a clever gambit, he even succeeded in getting his whisky classified as medicine in the United States – no doubt partially due to Laphroaig's characteristic medicinal aromas – thus bypassing the harsh restrictions on alcohol during the Prohibition era. Hunter died childless in 1954 and was unable to find anyone in his extended family who he felt equipped to continue his vision of the company.  He therefore decided to leave it to his former secretary turned manager, Bessie Williamson, making Laphroaig the first distillery in Islay to be owned and led by a woman.

Branded as *“the most richly flavoured of all Scotch whiskies,”* Laphroaig is known for its unapologetically intense flavor profile: billows of peat smoke, medicinal iodine, seaweed brine paired with a creamy, oily mouthfeel. The spirit is made using heavily peated malt (around 40 ppm) and tall copper stills with narrow necks that encourage reflux, yielding a full-bodied yet surprisingly elegant dram. The distillery leans into its polarizing reputation, most famously with the “*Opinions Welcome*” campaign, in which drinkers were invited (and encouraged) to share their honest and unfiltered opinions. True to its image, many reviews were used as part of the campaign: the good, the bad, and the hilariously hostile. What other brand would proudly embrace the tagline: *“Tastes like burning hospital”?*

Another distinctive initiative is the *Friends of Laphroaig* club. Many bottles include a registration code that entitles you to become a Friend, which makes you the ceremonial owner of a square foot of land on Islay. While you won’t be collecting rent, you are entitled to one free dram per year, payable at the distillery itself, giving you yet another incentive to visit the facilities!

Fun fact: Laphroaig is the only distillery officially approved by royalty, in this case former HRH The Prince Of Wales, King Charles III, who upon visiting Laphroaig and tasting their whisky granted the appointment. Even today, this approval is still proudly printed on the label of each bottle.

Currently Laphroaig's core range consists of the following editions:

| Name                          | Age              | Maturation                                         | Peat level | Alcohol | Aromas                                                                  |

| 30 Year Old                   | 30 years         | American oak + European ex-sherry                  | ~40-45 ppm | 45.8%   | Tropical fruits, lime zest, sea salt, gentle smouldering campfire smoke |

Additionally, like most producers, Laphroaig regularly releases special editions, be it for festivals, like the Islay Jazz Festival or Fèis Ìle, to commemorate milestones in the distillery’s history, or as the result of experimentation (both intentional **and** unintentional). I had the opportunity to take part in a guided tasting of Laphroaig’s *Elements* series, which showcases exactly that: deliberate trials as well as fortunate mistakes.

The first release, **Elements 1.0**, introduced a variation in the mashing process. In addition to the two standard 5.5-tonne mash tuns, an older 8.5-tonne tun was brought back into use. The wort was created using a 50/50 blend of cloudy and semi-cloudy runoff, aiming to influence the flavor profile at an early stage. Fermentation proceeded along the usual 55-hour cycle. This produced a complex whisky with notes of spicy pepper, charred pineapple, and tangy liquorice, offering bold and tropical-toned flavors layered over the signature medicinal peat.

**Elements 2.0** took another approach: Returning to the standard mash tuns and wort clarity but this time dialing up the fermentation time from the default 55 hours all the way up to 115 hours. The result is intensely aromatic and fruit-forward, with delicate smoke, soft peat, yeasty undertones, and a gentle sweetness. The trial was reportedly so successful that Laphroaig is now considering increasing the fermentation time for its core expressions to 72 hours.

Finally, **Elements 3.0** was born from a mistake – or as the late Bob Ross would put it, a *happy little accident*. One of the kiln fires was left burning for longer and at a higher temperature than intended, which would usually render the malt unsuitable for further processing. Instead, the distillery team took a chance, distilled it, and filled it into designated casks rather than blending it with the core range. Their gamble paid off: the prolonged, elevated heat imparted chocolate, coffee, and sweet, smoky notes, resulting in a unique, roasted character in the final spirit.

My personal favorite was Elements 2.0, but sadly I am not alone in that assessment and as a consequence of its popularity, the price has gotten a bit prohibitive. Alas, a man can dream.

## Lagavulin

![islay distilleries](images/lagavulin_destillery2.png "500px")

Edged in between Laphroaig and Ardbeg, crossed by a small creek and hemmed in by coastline, lies the Lagavulin distillery, one of Islay's most iconic names, and a personal favorite of actor Nick Offerman (incidentally it was also it was also the whisky of choice for Ron Swanson, the character he played on the sitcom "Parks and Recreation", in which Lagavulin was featured prominently in several episodes). But Offerman was hardly the first to cherish their whiskies – Lagavulin has a long history. Its origins trace back to 1816, when it was formally founded by John Johnston on the site of an earlier illicit distilling operation. Its name stems from the Gaelic *Lag a’ Mhuilinn*, meaning “hollow of the mill.” After Johnston’s death, the distillery passed through several owners before landing in the hands of Peter Mackie in the late 19th century. A key figure in whisky history, Mackie expanded Lagavulin’s reach and, after losing distribution rights for neighboring Laphroaig, famously built the *Malt Mill* distillery next door in 1908 as a sort of competitive counterpoint. Under his stewardship, Lagavulin became a key malt in the *White Horse* blend, boosting its commercial prominence. Following Mackie’s death and various corporate consolidations, ownership eventually passed to **Distillers Company Limited (DCL)**, a forerunner of today’s **Diageo**, which absorbed Lagavulin into its broader portfolio.

Stepping inside their little visitor shop feels like traveling back in time: white wood-panneled walls are juxtaposed by sage green racks and chestnut-toned bookshelves lending the room a maritime flair. Stepping further into the building you'll find rooms dominated by solid maroon wood giving off well-preserved antique charm and radiating the kind of quiet warmth that is usually reserved to historic, weathered pubs, like the ones in Edinburgh's old town. Another highlight was the distillery's bar, which overlooks one of the tasting rooms and offers a wide selection of distillery exclusives as well as mainland whiskies (though why you would go all the way to the distillery to taste non-Lagavulin whiskies I cannot say). The barkeeper was very knowledgeable and in addition to the many excellent fixed tasting packages, was also happy to create a bespoke selection just for us. The production tour was interesting and well structured but not particularly special, the tasting we had featured mainly their core range plus one Jazz edition, with the distillery exclusive standing out to us. 

Lagavulin operates two wash stills (11,000 L) and two spirit stills (~12,500 L), giving it an annual capacity of between 1.4 and 2.4 million litres, making it one of the larger operations on the island. Its malt, peated to around 35 ppm, sits below Ardbeg and Laphroaig in intensity, yet the whisky is anything but restrained. Thanks to its signature slow distillation – with the first run lasting around five hours and the second close to nine – combined with wide spirit cuts and minimal copper contact, the resulting spirit is weighty, oily, and layered. The flavor is marked by deep peat smoke, iodine, seaweed wrapped in notes of black tea, dried fruit, spice, and coastal salinity.

For most whisky drinkers, the Lagavulin 16 is their first encounter with the distillery — and rightly so. It remains the most iconic and widely available expression in the range, offering a deep, smoky introduction to the house style. Originally conceived as a limited release, the Lagavulin 8 has since earned permanent status in the core lineup, serving as the younger, brasher sibling to the 16: leaner, livelier, and more raw in character. Finally there is the Distillers Edition, closely related to the 16 in age and DNA, but given an extra layer of refinement through secondary maturation. The current Distillers Edition undergoes a finishing period in Pedro Ximénez (PX) sherry-seasoned casks, giving it a softer texture, longer finish and aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, spices and a touch of sweetness.

| Name                | Age      | Maturation                                          | Peat level | Alcohol | Aromas                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8 Year Old          | 8 years  | refill European oak + American oak casks            | 35 ppm     | 48%     | smoke, citrus, vanilla, and medium-bodied peat presence        |
| 16 Year Old         | 16 years | ex-Bourbon                                          | 35 ppm     | 43%     | Peat smoke, iodine, gentle sweetness, sea-salt, vanilla, spice |
| Distiller's Edition | NAS      | refill European oak + American oak casks, PX sherry | 35 ppm     | 43%     | Peat smoke with dark fruit, chocolate, sweet spice             |

Beyond the standard lineup, Lagavulin also releases regular special editions. As the lead sponsor of the annual Islay Jazz Festival, it’s no surprise that the limited bottlings created for the event receive particular attention. In my experience, these festival editions tend to be among the most experimental and intriguing expressions the distillery produces and if you ever get the chance to try one, I strongly recommend you take it.

## Ardnahoe

the distillery

Ardnahoe is the new kid on the block, having only been founded in 2017 and opening in 2019 and aiming at bridging tradition and modernity. It is situated in the north-east corner of Islay near Port Askaig, between Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila, the distillery seemingly perched upon a ledge, offering a magnificent view over the Sound of Islay and Paps of Jura. The facilities offer a stark contrast to those of the incumbent producers, eschewing the traditional white stone and pitched slate roofs for geometric, almost brutalistic cement buildings crowned by grey metal roofs. 

Hidden inside the buildings are a 2.5 ton mash tun, four Oregon pine washbacks, one wash still (~13 000 L) and one spirit still (~11 000 L), providing a combined capacity  for up to 600 000 L/year. 

Even though we might need to wait a bit longer for new releases, many locals were already highly impressed by the distillery so far and were projecting a great future, so stay in the lookout, especially while early editions may still be comparatively cheap!

Peat levels range from 5 ppm (lightly peated) up to 40 ppm, with a focus on mid-range peat offering coastal richness at approachable intensity  .

Features unique worm-tub condensers (the only ones on Islay) and long lyne arms (7.5 m), which promote reflux and create a fuller, meaty mouthfeel  .

Typical maturation split: ~80% ex-bourbon American oak and 20% ex-European Oloroso sherry casks  .

## Kilchoman

the distillery
Founded by Anthony Wills in 2005, Kilchoman became the first new distillery on Islay in over 120 years, starting production in December 2005, with the inaugural release arriving in 2009
Located on Rockside Farm in northwest Islay—Kilchoman is unique as an Islay farm distillery, growing around 30% of its barley on-site, malting it in-house (using traditional floor maltings), and handling distillation, maturation, and bottling all on one farm 

Fun Fact: As a farm-to-bottle distillery, Kilchoman grows barley, malts it onsite, and distills it—all on Islay. One day a guide joked, “If you get lost, just follow the barley to the bottle.”

A true farm distillery, controlling everything from barley seed to bottling 
Uses long fermentation and small stills for a signature clean yet fruity spirit; the high PPM barley is often softened by their process 
Maintains consistent signature peat levels (~50 ppm) in its peated range, but also offers lighter, farm-only expressions (~20 ppm) for diversity 
Peat Levels (PPM):

Kilchoman uses its own lightly peated malt (~20 ppm) for its 100% Islay range, and imported heavily peated malt (~50 ppm from Port Ellen Maltings) for its signature releases 

Fermentation: Long ferments of around 84–90 hours, which add fruity complexity and soften phenolic intensity 

Distillation: Uses compact bold stills with tall necks and reflux bulbs to create a cleaner spirit and moderate carryover of peat compounds 

Primarily 1st-fill bourbon casks (~90%), supplemented with ex-Oloroso sherry for richer notes; casks are usually discarded after two fills to maintain oak potency

## Bruichladdich

the distillery

Founded in 1881 by the Harvey brothers, Bruichladdich was designed as a state-of-the-art distillery built from purpose-built stone rather than converting farm buildings, with tall slender stills for a purer spirit 
It was mothballed multiple times (1907–18, 1929–35, 1941–45, 1994–2000) until reopened in 2001 by Mark Reynier and Jim McEwan, prioritizing terroir, local barley, and experimentation over marketing clichés 
Acquired by Rémy Cointreau in 2012, the distillery today emphasizes Scottish provenance, working with farmers and even naming specific fields on packaging 

Fun Fact: Bruichladdich once distilled a 90% ABV whisky dubbed “perilous usquebaugh‑baul”—the Top Gear crew even used some to fuel a car!

style
Bruichladdich is known for its unpeated, elegant, floral spirit—unusual on Islay—as their malt typically measures just 3–5 ppm, making it very light on smoke 
Spirit is derived from tall-narrow stills, long fermentation times, and traditional Victorian mash tun (gravity fed) for a refined, clean profile with cereal sweetness and citrus notes 
The distillery emphasizes varietal and vintage barley, often offering expressions like Islay Barley, Organic, and Bere Barley, which showcase terroir and vintage differences 
Purist unpeated style with barley transparency and elegance.
Terroir‑focused ethos, naming farm, field, and vintage in core bottlings.
Innovative experimentation, through Octomore and Port Charlotte, pushing peat to its limits without losing finesse.
Strong sense of identity and design, rejecting whisky clichés and embracing honesty and clarity both in spirit and presentation 

## Bowmore

the distillery
Established in 1779 by John P. Simson, Bowmore is the oldest licensed distillery on Islay and one of the oldest in Scotland 
The distillery sits in the village of Bowmore on the south-eastern shore of Loch Indaal. It draws water from the Laggan River, which contributes slight peat tones (~2 ppm) to the new spirit 
Runs a traditional floor maltings, providing around 30% of its malt — peat kilned to ~25 ppm — with the remainder from external maltsters 
Annual production sits at ~1.7–2 million liters, using two wash stills and two spirit stills 

In Skyfall, Bowmore 1964 is the whisky served in James Bond’s ancestral home. That is no accident: Bowmore has a long-standing partnership with Aston Martin, offering limited releases like “Black Bowmore DB5 1964” (a £50,000 collector’s piece housed inside a functioning Aston Martin engine block).

style
Bowmore’s whisky is medium-peated, typically around 25–30 ppm phenols — less intense than its southern Islay neighbors yet smoky enough to be distinct 
Flavor is characterized by the interplay of coastal peat smoke, Oloroso sherry sweetness, saline maritime notes, and a viscous, oily mouthfeel 
Maturation heavily features first-fill American oak barrels (~86%) and ~14% first-fill Oloroso sherry casks, creating balanced “smoky & sweet” profiles 
The legendary No. 1 Vaults is a historic below-sea-level cellar used for aging premium stock; its high humidity and salt air impart restrained evaporation (~1%) and unique maritime maturity to the whisky 

Peat levels (~25–30 ppm) offer a balanced smoke—lighter than Laphroaig or Ardbeg, but more assertive than Bruichladdich.
The No. 1 Vaults environment (below sea level, high humidity, salt air) shapes Bowmore’s signature texture and marine character with less spirit loss 
Bowmore maintains traditional floor malting, rare among Islay distilleries today, supporting terroir-rich barley-derived character 
Sherry finishing innovation—like the “Darkest,” Vault Edition, Mizunara oak, or Aston Martin Arc‑52—enhances complexity while staying rooted in maritime peat style.

Bowmore sits at the smoky-sweet intersection: moderate peat, expressive sherry, salted sea breeze, warm oak, and refined elegance—perfect for those seeking maritime smoke but with balance.

the distillery
Fun Fact: The peat they use comes from the Castlehill bog—rightly named, because it gives their whisky a briny, “seaside bandage” character you can practically taste.

## Bunnahabhain

The journey to Bunnahabhain, nestled in Islay’s remote northeastern corner, winds along narrow, hilly roads framed by breathtaking scenery — until the view suddenly opens up to reveal the dramatic expanse of Bunnahabhain Bay, with the distillery perched at its edge. This spectacular view alone almost makes a visit worthwile. One of the first things to catch the eye is the iconic *helmsman* logo — a tribute to the hardy sailors who once braved the stormy Sound of Islay to deliver vital supplies. This emblem adorns the distillery buildings and bottles alike, and even lends its name the *Stiùireadair* edition. The sea clearly plays a major role for the destillery, leaving visible marks upon the historic white buildings and imparting a briny freshness to the whisky itself.

Bunnahabhain is one of the few Islay distilleries known primarily for unpeated whisky, featuring often aromas of dried fruits, roasted nuts, and subtle salinity. In recent years, they’ve also introduced a smaller range of peated expressions — such as the **Toiteach A‑Dhà** (Gaelic for *Smoky Two*) which sits at around 35 to 45 ppm. Their unpeated spirit is celebrated for its creamy texture and robust body while avoiding the intense smoke typical of Islay malt and thus offering a welcome reprieve for those less particular to the smoky and medicinal flavors the island's whiskies are known for. A typical taste profile includes hints of nuts, dried fruits, maritime salinity with a distinctive mouthfeel often described as rich and oily. Distillation occurs in the tallest stills on Islay, encouraging a lighter, more refined spirit as heavier compounds are left behind. Bunnahabhain favors sherry-seasoned casks for maturation, contributing to its signature fruity, nutty style. Some editions are also aged in coastal warehouses, where the sea air slowly adds a salty, maritime nuance.

Bunnahabhain core range consists of the following whiskies:

| Name           | Age      | Maturation       | Peat level | Alcohol | Aromas                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12 Year Whisky | 12 years | Bourbon & sherry | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | sweet fruit, vanilla, nuts, subtle brine                               |
| Stiuireadair   | NAS      | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | dried fruit, salted caramel, rich mouthfeel                            |
| Toiteach A‑Dhà | NAS      | Bourbon & sherry | 36 ppm     | 46.3%   | oaky, peppered peat, smoke, sweet sherry notes                         |

| 25 Year Whisky | 25 years | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | Roasted nuts, sweet berries, caramel, luxurious mouthfeel              |
| 30 Year Whisky | 30 years | Ex-sherry        | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | Creamy berries, caramel, mature and elegant                            |
| 40 Year Whisky | 40 years | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 41.9%   | Ultra-matured: tropic fruits, creamy sweetness, vanilla & toasted nuts |

Special editions and distillery exclusives are often significantly more experimental regarding the selection of casks, featuring different finishes like Roja, Amarone, Rum, PX and Amontillado, to give additional complexity to the whisky. 

For Fèis Ìle 2025 Bunnahabhain released not just a single bottle but instead a three bottle lineup, consistent of three editions: **Turas Math** (Gaelic for good journey) No.1, No.2 and No.3, together part of the **Westering Home Collection**, a series exploring the themes of return, journey and longing for Islay. Here too the main difference lies in the selection of casks and the aging duration: No. 1 is matured in Manzanilla and with Amarone cask finish, No. 2 was aged in ex-bourbon and finished in Palo Cortado sherry barrels and No. 3 finished in a rare Armagnac cask.

# Port Ellen

Port Ellen was something of a unicorn on our trip. Our self-imposed quest was simple: taste at least one dram from every Islay distillery. But Port Ellen proved a tough nut to crack. When we asked the bartender at the excellent Lochside Hotel in Bowmore whether he had anything from the long-defunct distillery, he gestured wearily toward an unassuming bottle locked behind glass. The price? £15,000. We smiled politely and graciously passed.

Originally founded as a malt mill in 1825, Port Ellen distilled whisky until 1930, when it shut down during the Great Depression. Its first revival lasted from 1967 to 1983, during which it expanded to four stills and added a large drum maltings, making it one of the island's primary barley suppliers. Since then it lay dormant, until Diageo decided to rebuild the site, officially reopening it in March 2024 as a carbon‑neutral, state‑of‑the‑art facility.

The reimagined distillery now houses two sets of copper stills: “Phoenix,” which follows the original design, and “Experimental,” a more adventurous arrangement aimed at innovation. In fact, the plans for the former were reverse-engineered from 40-year-old blueprints and decommissioned equipment to ensure the reborn whisky stays faithful to its smoky legacy. A newly engineered Ten‑Part Spirit Safe complements the system. Housed in a striking modernist structure with a large glass façade, the stills are even visible from outside.

When we passed by during Fèis Ìle week, the unmistakable scent of malt and peat hung in the air—a clear sign that Port Ellen had resumed production. If you’re hoping for a dram from the new make, though, you’ll need patience: Since the whisky needs to mature, the first official release isn’t expected to hit the market before 2032.

During its tenure the distillery was known as a pioneer and innovator: It was reportedly among the first to export single malts to North America (with some sources claiming as early as 1848) and one of the first adopters of the spirit safe. After its second closure, the whiskies reached somewhat of a cult status, finding widespread acclaim (and fetching staggering prices) thanks to their distinctive and complex peaty, leathery and citrus-rich profile. Diageo began annual official releases in 2001 using remaining casks (1978–79).

Independent bottlers added to the legend, releasing coveted editions like the 1979 37‑year‑old, the ethereal “Eidolon” 40‑year, and a 1983 32‑year—each greeted with rave reviews.
