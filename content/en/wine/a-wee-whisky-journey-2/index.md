In my [previous post](https://mlangstrof.github.io/en/wine/a-wee-whisky-journey-1/), I set the stage for a deeper dive into Islay whisky by walking you through its production — highlighting the unique conditions, machinery, and techniques that give rise to this sublime spirit. Now that we've covered the ‘how,’ I’d love to take you on a short journey through Islay’s iconic distilleries — sharing personal impressions, curious facts, and perhaps helping you discover which house might best suit your palate

# Islay and its whisky

Chances are, the first thing to greet you on Islay — whether you arrive by sea or sky — will be brisk winds and perhaps a brief, involuntary shower. Set adrift from the Scottish mainland, the island is sculpted by unrelenting maritime gusts with little in the way of natural protection - while the inland features gentle hills and modest peaks, the coastal areas remain open, flat and exposed. The salty ocean air feels instantly refreshing and rejuvenating and is one of the key elements that imprint a distinctive character onto Islay’s whiskies. 

As you head inland, a landscape of luscious green fields unfolds, that reminded me instantly of the *Emerald Isle*. Our cab driver pointed out that Ireland is not only close by, but that on a clear day, you can even glimpse its coastline with the naked eye. In fact Islay is almost equidistant from Scotland and Ireland and its vegetation certainly reflects that. The vivid green is interspersed with brown spots, which are indicative of the peat that the island is known for - and another crucial aspect that shapes the character of the local whisky. Peat is a unique type of soil formed from partially decomposed plant matter, layered over time into dense, dark slabs that resemble dried earth. Due to the compression that happens over time while layer upon layer gets added to the top, it is quite energy dense and somewhere between wood and coal. Curiously, peat has little to no aroma on its own - its famously smoky character only emerges when it’s set alight. 

Of course the rugged, rural landscape wouldn't be complete without some livestock and you'll often see sheep and cows grazing on the meadows. Rumor has it, even the island’s livestock are whisky enthusiasts - they’re especially fond of *draff*, the protein- and fiber-rich barley residue left behind in the mash tun after mashing. It is rich in protein and fiber, but low in sugar, yet still retains a slightly sweetish taste that the animals rather enjoy. The island is also home to farms that grow hay, silage and barley, the latter being used primarily in the local whisky production. Move your gaze towards the open waters and you might see some fishing boats, catching crabs, lobsters, scallops, oysters or fish from the island's coast, delicacies which you are sure to find on the menu of the restaurants in Port Ellen, Bowmore or Port Charlotte. 

Only around 3,000 people call Islay home year-round, scattered among its villages, farms, and cottages - even fewer are actually born there and are thus allowed to call themselves Ìleach (pronounced *ilach*). The natives are very welcoming, friendly and humble, and even though their whisky has found worldwide acclaim, they still seem very much down to earth. I was pleasantly surprised that even though especially the bigger distilleries have their fixed catalog of whiskies, tours and tasting experiences, not everything is about money and you will often get more than you paid for. If you visit high-profile wineries, it can sometimes feel like an expensive, rushed and highly choreographed experience, far removed from any joy about the actual product. Islay felt more authentic and the inhabitants genuinely proud and excited about their Island and their spirits and eager to share their enthusiasm.

# The Fèis Ìle festival

[Fèis Ìle](https://feisile.co.uk/) (pronounced roughly  *fesh eel-uh*) is an annual celebration of Islay and its renowned distilleries, taking place during the last week of May. The origins of the festival date back to 1986, making next year (2026) its 40th anniversary. Over the festival’s ten-day run, each day spotlights a different distillery. Expect bustling courtyards brimming with food and drink stalls, live music on central stages, and exclusive behind-the-scenes tours. Many distilleries also offer immersive tasting experiences — from curated flights of rare casks to access to normally off-limits areas, cocktail workshops, blend-your-own classes, or informal meet-and-greets with the head distiller or distillery manager. 

Each distillery brings its own flair to the occasion — some, like Bruichladdich, host raucous, high-energy parties, while others, such as Laphroaig, favor a more laid-back, family-friendly atmosphere, complete with historic charm and even activities like archery. Beyond the distilleries, the festival committee organizes a wide range of events — from whisky tasting contests and music-and-dance performances to showcases by independent bottlers. There’s even room for non-whisky related fun, like fishing competitions or community bowling nights.

Most distillery days are open to all, often with no ticket required. However, special tastings and committee-run events do book out fast,  so be sure to reserve your spot well in advance.

# The distilleries of Islay

Islay is currently home to ten active distilleries, scattered across its wild and windswept terrain. On the southern coast lie **Ardbeg**, **Lagavulin**, **Laphroaig**, and the recently reopened **Port Ellen**; **Bowmore**, **Bruichladdich**, and **Kilchoman** anchor the island’s west, while **Caol Ila**, **Ardnahoe**, and **Bunnahabhain** are tucked along the northwestern shore. Two new sites — **Portintruan** near Port Ellen and **Laggan Bay** near the airport — are already under construction and slated to open soon. The island’s oldest distillery is Bowmore, named after Islay’s capital city, where it was founded shortly after the town itself in 1779. 

Intriguingly, many distilleries predate their official founding dates, having operated as illicit stills during the days when whisky production was outlawed. That’s why some sites feature hidden rock caverns — once used to stash barrels of moonshine during the prohibition era. According to local lore, some resourceful maltmen even diverted smoke from the kilns and stillhouses into the chimneys of nearby cottages, thus cleverly concealing the telltale signs of their forbidden craft.

## Bunnahabhain

The journey to Bunnahabhain, nestled in Islay’s remote northeastern corner, winds along narrow, hilly roads framed by breathtaking scenery — until the view suddenly opens up to reveal the dramatic expanse of Bunnahabhain Bay, with the distillery perched at its edge. This spectacular view alone almost makes a visit worthwile. One of the first things to catch the eye is the iconic *helmsman* logo — a tribute to the hardy sailors who once braved the stormy Sound of Islay to deliver vital supplies. This emblem adorns the distillery buildings and bottles alike, and even lends its name the *Stiùireadair* edition. The sea clearly plays a major role for the destillery, leaving visible marks upon the historic white buildings and imparting a briny freshness to the whisky itself.

Bunnahabhain is one of the few Islay distilleries known primarily for unpeated whisky, featuring often aromas of dried fruits, roasted nuts, and subtle salinity. In recent years, they’ve also introduced a smaller range of peated expressions — such as the **Toiteach A‑Dhà** (Gaelic for *Smoky Two*) which sits at around 35 to 45 ppm. Their unpeated spirit is celebrated for its creamy texture and robust body while avoiding the intense smoke typical of Islay malt and thus offering a welcome reprieve for those less particular to the smoky and medicinal flavors the island's whiskies are known for. A typical taste profile includes hints of nuts, dried fruits, maritime salinity with a distinctive mouthfeel often described as rich and oily. Distillation occurs in the tallest stills on Islay, encouraging a lighter, more refined spirit as heavier compounds are left behind. Bunnahabhain favors sherry-seasoned casks for maturation, contributing to its signature fruity, nutty style. Some editions are also aged in coastal warehouses, where the sea air slowly adds a salty, maritime nuance.

Bunnahabhain core range consists of the following whiskies:

| name           | age      | maturation       | peat level | alcohol | aromas                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12 Year Whisky | 12 years | Bourbon & sherry | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | sweet fruit, vanilla, nuts, subtle brine                               |
| Stiuireadair   | NAS      | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | dried fruit, salted caramel, rich mouthfeel                            |
| Toiteach A‑Dhà | NAS      | Bourbon & sherry | 36 ppm     | 46.3%   | oaky, peppered peat, smoke, sweet sherry notes                         |
| 18 Year Whisky | 18 years | Sherry finish    | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | dried fruit, spice, honey, salinity, thick & nutty                     |
| 25 Year Whisky | 25 years | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | Roasted nuts, sweet berries, caramel, luxurious mouthfeel              |
| 30 Year Whisky | 30 years | Ex-sherry        | 2-4 ppm    | 46.3%   | Creamy berries, caramel, mature and elegant                            |
| 40 Year Whisky | 40 years | Sherry           | 2-4 ppm    | 41.9%   | Ultra-matured: tropic fruits, creamy sweetness, vanilla & toasted nuts |

Special editions and distillery exclusives are often significantly more experimental regarding the selection of casks, featuring different finishes like Roja, Amarone, Rum, PX and Amontillado, to give additional complexity to the whisky. 

For Fèis Ìle 2025 Bunnahabhain released not just a single bottle but instead a three bottle lineup, consistent of three editions: **Turas Math** (Gaelic for good journey) No.1, No.2 and No.3, together part of the **Westering Home Collection**, a series exploring the themes of return, journey and longing for Islay. Here too the main difference lies in the selection of casks and the aging duration: No. 1 is matured in Manzanilla and with Amarone cask finish, No. 2 was aged in ex-bourbon and finished in Palo Cortado sherry barrels and No. 3 finished in a rare Armagnac cask.
