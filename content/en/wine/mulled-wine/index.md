As the days grow shorter and Christmas decorations begin to light up our streets, the festive spirit comes alive. With the start of Advent, Christmas markets are finally opening in most places, bringing with them the delightful aromas of Bratwurst, Raclette, gingerbread, and — of course — Glühwein. But what makes a good Glühwein, and can you make it at home?

Mulled wine, or **Glühwein** as it's known in German-speaking countries, is essentially spiced wine and can be made with either red or white wine as the base. To the wine, you add a variety of spices — usually seasonal ones like cinnamon, star anise, and cloves — to give it more depth and warmth. You can also incorporate fruit juices, most commonly orange juice, to make the Glühwein a bit easier to drink and to add sweetness and acidity. Some people prefer to give it a little extra kick by adding a shot of rum, brandy, cognac, or other liqueurs.

# Three Steps to the Perfect Glühwein
## 1. Choose the Right Base Wine
When selecting the wine for your Glühwein, consider what you want in the finished drink. Do you prefer a lighter or heavier wine? What aromas would you like the wine to bring? What structure are you aiming for (i.e., the amount and coarseness of tannins and phenolic expression)?

Keep in mind that the spices place some constraints on your wine selection. If the wine is too bold, it may overpower the spices; if it's too light, it can be overwhelmed by them. Also consider that the wine's natural aromas should harmonize with the spices you add. Finally, I would advise against highly acidic wines — especially if they are dry — as the added orange juice can make the resulting Glühwein too sour. So, which wine should you choose?

- For a *light, fruity* Glühwein, try a **Beaujolais** for red or a **Sauvignon Blanc** for white.
- For a Glühwein with *medium body and silky tannins*, opt for a **Merlot** for red or an Alsatian **Pinot Gris** for white.
- For a Glühwein with *depth, structure, and complexity*, choose a **Pinot Noir** for red or an **oaked Chardonnay** for white.
- For an *easygoing, sweetish, crowd-pleasing* Glühwein, consider a **Primitivo/Zinfandel** for red or a budget-friendly off-dry **Riesling** (e.g., Kabinett) for white.

## 2. Add the Right Ingredients
Freshness is key for both spices and fruits — the fresher the ingredients, the more flavorful your Glühwein will be. For the spices, I recommend putting them into a small cloth bag, so you can keep track of them more easily. Essential spices include cinnamon, star anise, and cloves; some people also add nutmeg. Be sure to add sugar slowly — the amount depends on the wine you choose and your personal preference. Remember: It's easier to add more sugar than to remove it!

## 3. Heat to the Right Temperature
Wine aromas are delicate, so you want to heat your wine slowly and evenly up to about 60°C (140°F). Do not overheat it, and most importantly, do not let it boil. At around 70°C (158°F), you start significantly losing alcohol and flavors. After you've heated the wine a bit, add the spices and orange slices (and juice if you want to), and let them impart their flavors for at least 10 minutes before removing them. Afterwards all that's left is to remove the spices and voilà — your homemade Glühwein is ready!

Of course, it doesn't always have to be mulled **wine**. If you prefer a *non-alcoholic* alternative, there's **winter punch**. You can find recipe cards for both below.
