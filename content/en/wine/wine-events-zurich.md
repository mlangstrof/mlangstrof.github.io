Due to it's central location and high purchasing power, Switzerland is at the top of the list for many wine exporters. Considering this, it makes sense that Zurich has a vibrant wine scene and can call itself home to multiple exciting wine fairs. Let's go over the most popular ones. 

*Please keep in mind the information below are based on previous experiences, ticket prices and locations may change in the future.*

# Expovina
**Expovina** is undoubtedly the centerpiece of Zurich’s wine scene, not just because of its scale but also its unique charm—it happens twice a year, with the autumn edition taking place on boats docked at the iconic Bürkliplatz piers. This setting creates a magical atmosphere. While it can feel a bit crowded and occasionally disorienting, the intimate, floating venue adds a special touch that’s hard to replicate.

Both the autumn and spring events showcase a remarkable array of vendors from all over the world with often special attention given to a specific country or region each year — often a smaller or emerging wine-producing nation. Expect a stellar representation of wines from both the Old World and the New World, alongside a rich selection of Swiss wines and some intriguing discoveries from lesser-known countries. You’ll also find master classes and food stalls to complement the wine-tasting experience.

For those who prefer solid ground, the spring edition of Expovina takes place at Puls 5, a stylish industrial venue near Hardbrücke. While it feels slightly smaller compared to the autumn event, it offers a more spacious layout. But don’t be fooled — weekends and evenings can get packed, so plan your visit accordingly!

The event organizers go above and beyond to make your experience smooth, with a highly detailed website that includes a layout of all the stands, making it easy to map out your tasting route. If the sheer variety of wines feels overwhelming, their well curated recommendations and awarded wines are a great starting point.

For wine enthusiasts, Expovina is an unmissable event. Even after countless visits, I find myself excited to return — to rediscover old favorites, unearth new gems, and stock up my wine cellar.

*Time: Primavera April/ Wine boats November*
*Location: Primavera Puls 5 / Wine boats Bürkliplatz*
*Ticket price: ~30 CHF*

# Zurich Wine Festival
The **Zurich Wine Festival**, held in autumn at the base of the Ütliberg in Sihlcity, offers a smaller, more focused alternative to Expovina while still delivering an impressive and diverse wine selection. Alongside the tastings, the festival features a variety of intriguing events and master classes, though the quality of these sessions can vary significantly depending on the lecturer.

One class I attended was rather disappointing as though the selection of wines was decent, the presenter made multiple false statements about Italian wines and was rather condescending, which left a bad taste (no pun intended). Fortunately, another class I joined was much more engaging and well-delivered.

On the exhibition floor, I found a fantastic range of wines. There were the classics: Verdicchio from Marche, Amarone from Valpolicella, and outstanding Pinot Noirs from Burgundy. But what truly stood out were the hidden gems—rare wines like Erbaluce and Timorasso, and even obscure grapes I had never tried before, such as Slarina.

One of the highlights of this festival is the presence of actual wine producers, not just merchants. Speaking directly with them about their wines and processes provides a deeper understanding of their craft and passion. I particularly enjoyed meeting smaller vineyard owners who are experimenting with unconventional grape varieties or innovative production techniques.

The producers and merchants at Zurich Wine Festival are approachable, knowledgeable, and eager to share their insights, making it an event I wholeheartedly recommend. However, when it comes to the master classes, I’d suggest exercising caution. Some are worth attending, but others might not meet your expectations.

Interestingly, I noticed one master class drop in price from 40 CHF to 20 CHF within a day due to — I assume — low registrations. While I sympathize with the organizers, it does raise the question of whether it’s worth committing to a class in advance unless it’s particularly popular or close to your heart.

All in all, the Zurich Wine Festival is a great event for wine lovers, with its mix of classic and rare finds, engaging producers, and vibrant atmosphere. Just approach the master classes with a bit of discernment!

# Matter Of Taste
Who hasn’t heard of the famous (or infamous?) Parker points, the rating system pioneered by wine critic Robert Parker that’s been around for what feels like an eternity. While wine critics and their scoring methods often spark debate — and some are more questionable than others (*cough* Luca Maroni *cough*) — I personally find Parker's system to be one of the more accurate ones.

Fittingly called **Matter of Taste**, the Parker event in Zurich is a celebration of excellence, showcasing only wines that have scored 90 points or higher. Naturally, this makes the wines — and the ticket prices — quite expensive. On the plus side, you have the chance to taste some truly outstanding wines, including a few that have achieved the coveted 100-point score. On the downside, this is still a wine fair at its core, designed to sell wine. This means many of the offerings, like young Barolos or Bordeauxs, are wines with incredible potential that will flourish in 10–30 years but, at least for me, are tough to enjoy now. Harsh, unintegrated tannins and the absence of the complex tertiary aromas that make these wines so fascinating can make them less than enjoyable in their youth.

If, like me, you attend out of curiosity, be prepared: not every wine will be a pleasure to drink. You’ll also encounter some big-name wines, such as Sassicaia or wines from Vega Sicilia, but don’t expect the best vintages. Some of these renowned, eye-wateringly expensive bottles left me surprisingly underwhelmed. That said, the 98–100-point wines are truly something else. Tasting a 100-point white wine at the event felt like experiencing perfection — like a flawless, immaculately crafted diamond, pure and exquisite, almost a work of art. 

However that does not necessarily mean they are approachable or "fun" — I would compare this to watching a well-regarded and much lauded movie, like the Godfather; while it's an amazing film (or rather, film series), to truly appreciate it you need to pay close attention, while sometimes you might be more in the mood for a simple action pop-corn flick. 

In summary, this event is both unique and intriguing, and if money is no object, it’s absolutely worth experiencing — at least once. However, for most wine enthusiasts, Zurich’s other wine fairs offer a more enjoyable and budget-friendly experience, with plenty of phenomenal wines waiting to be discovered. For me, the Parker event will likely remain a one-time adventure — but a memorable one nonetheless.

# Terroir Zürisee
No roundup of Zurich wine events would be complete without a nod to **Terroir Zürisee**, the charming, lakeside festival celebrating wines from the Lake Zurich region. While you’ll find plenty of familiar favorites like Pinot Noir (Blauburgunder), Sauvignon Blanc, and Chardonnay, the real gems are the local specialties. From the fantastic indigenous grape Räuschling to Swiss classics like Petit Arvine and Heida, there’s a lot to explore.

Some producers even bring a sense of adventure with experimental varieties, including PiWis (fungus-resistant hybrids). On my last visit, I had the chance to try Prior and was pleasantly surprised by its character and quality. The festival naturally leans toward whites over reds, reflecting the strengths of the region, but the diversity of styles ensures there’s something for everyone.

Set in a charming venue near Tiefenbrunnen, Terroir Zürisee is the perfect spot for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of Swiss wines or connect with local producers. For all those wanting to extend their knowledge of Swiss wines or meet some local producers, I recommend a visit!
