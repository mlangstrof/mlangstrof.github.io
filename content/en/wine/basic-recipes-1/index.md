As I explained in my [previous post](https://mlangstrof.github.io/en/wine/food-and-wine-basics/), a perfect *marriage* of food and wine can elevate both and unlock a whole new level of culinary enjoyment. But starting out can seem like a daunting task. What wines match with which recipes? 

I’m by no means a master chef, but I’ve written down a few of my favorite recipes - easy and straightforward to make - and included some suggested wine pairings to help anyone else exploring this path.

# Potato Pancakes
**Potato Pancakes** are a wonderful dish because you probably already have the ingredients at home. All you need are potatoes, eggs, flour, and a grater. Peel the potatoes, grate them, then gently press out any excess water.

Next, mix in the eggs and flour, season to taste, and shape the mixture into patties. Fry them in oil until they’re golden brown and crispy. You can also grate a carrot or zucchini and add it to the raw mixture for extra color and flavor. 

In Germany, these pancakes are traditionally served with applesauce and pair well with **Riesling**, **Chardonnay**, or even a light **Pinot Noir**.

# Quiche Lorraine
A good **quiche** can win over just about anyone, and it’s much simpler to prepare than it looks. You can buy pre-made dough, but it’s also easy to make from scratch - just combine flour, water, butter, and a little salt; chill it briefly in the fridge; and voilà, you’re ready to roll.

From there, mix the filling ingredients (minus the Parmesan). Roll out the dough so that it lines the inside of a baking dish, then pour in the filling. Finally, sprinkle the Parmesan on top for a lovely crust. Bake it at 180°C for around 30 minutes; the center should be mostly set by then - if not, give it a few more minutes.

Serve it with **Chardonnay** or **Sauvignon Blanc**; a light-bodied red like **Pinot Noir **also works nicely.

# Ratatouille
Thanks in part to Disney’s film about an exceptionally talented rat chef, **Ratatouille** has become a household name. While the version in the movie may be fit for a Michelin-starred restaurant, a beginner-friendly Ratatouille is both easy to make and wonderfully healthy. Start by creating a sauce: sauté diced tomatoes (or tomato paste), onions, and garlic until the onions turn translucent, then spread this mixture evenly in an ovenproof dish.

Slice eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes into rounds about 2–3 mm thick, then layer them in the dish on top of the sauce. Season with salt, pepper, olive oil, and herbs (Herbes de Provence are classic). Bake at 200°C for 50–60 minutes.

You can serve Ratatouille as a main dish - perhaps with fresh baguette or pasta - or as a side. Its veggie-forward, earthy flavors make it a natural match for a medium-bodied **Côtes du Rhône**, a **rosé **from Provence, or a crisp **Vermentino**.

# Chocolate Chip Cookies
Some say dessert is the best part of any meal, but whipping up something fancy can be time-consuming, especially if your main course already demands a lot of effort. A warm **chocolate chip cookie**, on the other hand, is a crowd-pleaser that’s quick to prepare.

Simply mix your ingredients (making sure the flour doesn’t form lumps), then chill the dough in the fridge for a few minutes before shaping the cookies. Bake them for around 20 minutes at 150-180°C (lower temperature means a longer baking time and less crispiness).

While they’re simple, chocolate chip cookies can be taken to new heights by pairing them with a glass of **Port**, **Vin Santo**, or **Sauternes**.
