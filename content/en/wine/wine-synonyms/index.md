Have you ever tasted two different wines but could swear it was the same grape? you might have been right after all, since for a lot of grapes, there are many different regional names as well as sometimes different biotypes. 
A biotype is a variant with minor genetic differences or variations in the grape composition, behavior or adaptability. These differences can arise due to natural mutations or environmental influences but are not distinct enough to classify them as a seperate variety.

Examples of **synonyms**, so different names for the same grapes, are:
- Blauburgunder or Sp√§tburgunder for Pinot Noir
- Shiraz for Syrah

Examples of **biotypes**, so local variations of the same grape, are:
- Brunello di Montalcino is a biotype of Sangiovese
- Pigato is a biotype of Vermentino
