Have you ever tasted two different wines and felt sure they were made from the same grape? Well, you might just be right! Many grape varieties go by different regional names, and some even have slight genetic variations known as biotypes.

A synonym is simply a locally different name for the same grape—genetically identical but called something else depending on where it’s grown.

A biotype, on the other hand, refers to a variant of the grape with subtle genetic differences or variations in its composition, behavior, or adaptability. These differences often come about through natural mutations or environmental influences, but they aren’t significant enough to classify the grape as a completely new variety.

Examples of **synonyms**, so different names for the same grapes, are:
- Blauburgunder or Spätburgunder for Pinot Noir
- Shiraz for Syrah

Examples of **biotypes**, so local variations of the same grape, are:
- Brunello di Montalcino is a biotype of Sangiovese
- Pigato is a biotype of Vermentino
