Welcome to my blog. My name is Max Langstrof and I'm an experienced DevOps engineer and solution architect with a lot of knowledge and history in planning, designing and realizing complex cloud based workloads.

I'm primarily focused around Azure and love the challenge of piecing together various components to build a novel, comprehensive, automated solution, as well as doing deep dive explorations to understand how the different Azure services work "under the hood" and can be best utilized.

This blog is meant as a collection of private projects, explanations of Azure topics, scripts and tools I found particularly helpful as well as thoughts and observations around all things related to working in IT.
